Suggested solution:
------------------
Add a "News section" button to the new tab with an indicator of the number of new unread news.
The number of new news to get by executing a request to the server once when the application starts.
When you click on the button, the counter on the unread news button is reset to zero and a page opens
with a list of all news arranged in descending order of the date of the news.
In the list, display the Title, Date and part of the text of the news.
In the list, mark the titles of new or not yet read news with the bold style.
When you click on a news in the list, open a page with the full content of the news.


Questions:
---------
- In what format will the news be presented? (HTML, XML, etc.)
- What fields are provided for news (Title, Text, Date, Image, etc.), How should they be placed in the view?
- How exactly do you want to see the news section: will it be a link or a button to a new tab or page?
- How often or at what time should a request be made to the server to check for new news.
  This will be a scheduled check or once when entering the application or by pressing a button or when entering a bookmark (news page);
  Will there be a request to receive the number of new news?
- Is it necessary to mark the user as read after viewing the news and visually mark or hide from the list of news;
